# MERN_Task

Welcome to the **MERN_Task** repository!  
This project is a practical implementation of a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application focused on task management.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **MongoDB** - NoSQL database for storing tasks  
- **Express.js** - Backend framework for API development  
- **React.js** - Frontend library for building user interfaces  
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime for server-side logic  
- **Axios** - For making HTTP requests from React to backend  
- **Bootstrap** - Styling and responsive UI components

## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

### Backend

1. Navigate to backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend

1. Navigate to frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React app:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`
